 * $Log: PositionUpdater.java,v $
 * Revision 1.3  2005/07/25 01:29:38  rohanr2
 * trying to clean up the asserts and the unused variable warnings... I just commented out the parts that had unused variables and replaced all asserts with IllegalArgumentExceptions. I only got through about half the code base.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2005/02/01 01:52:49  smilligan
 * Fixed a couple of issues with the partitioner.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2005/01/31 08:01:13  smilligan
 * Refactored a lot of the partitioner so it is more manageable. This should be the final refactor I think. From here on in it ought to be performance tweaks and bug fixes.
