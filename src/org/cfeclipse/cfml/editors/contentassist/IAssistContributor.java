/**
 * <p>
 * All clients that wish to provide assist for documents should implement
 * this interface. Plugins should register their contributors with the
 * CFE core (please see ... for registration information).
 * </p><br/>
 * The CFE core assistors compute the assist state information that is
 * kept in a class derived from AssistState. The assistor then calls each
 * assist contributor for a specific assist type (tag, attribute, attr value,
 * etc.) and asks it whether it will contribute.
 *
 * Once the list of contributors that will contribute is gathered they will
 * have their getProposals() called. The core assist will perform some finalising
 * on the gathered contributions and present them to the user.
 *
 * The gathering process is based upon a first-come, first-serve method.
 * 
 * This type of contributor will be asked to contribute every time the user invokes
 * content assist in a CFML context where they're not after attribute or attribute
 * value insight. You may, of course, implement this interface and the attribute/
 * attribute insight assist interfaces.
