/**
 * This class outputs debugging information and should be used in place of
 * System.out.println(); when you want to find out what's going on in your
 * code.
 * 
 * The main reason for using this class instead is so that we can modify
 * the behaviour in the future to write the output to a debug view or to a log 
 * file, so if a particular user is having issues with a build of CFEclipse
 * we can give them a build with the relevant debug flags in DebugSettings
 * turned on.
 * 
 * Usage for this class should be of the form:
 * 
 * if (DebugSettings.PARSER) {
 * 	DebugUtils.printMessage("Something happened in the parser.");
 * }
 * 
 * The rationale being that the fields in DebugSettings are declared as 
 * public static final boolean, so the compiler replaces them with the boolean
 * value at compile time. When it sees the if statement above it the reads it
 * as either:
 * 
 * if(true) {
 * 	DebugUtils.printMessage(getClass(),"Something happened in the parser.");
 * }
 * 
 * or 
 * if (false) {
 * 	DebugUtils.printMessage(getClass(),"Something happened in the parser.");
 * }
 * 
 * In the first case, the compiler will remove the if statmement and leave this:
 *  
 * DebugUtils.printMessage(getClass(),"Something happened in the parser.");
 * 
 * In the second case it will remove the whole statement. In other words, the debug
 * code incurs zero runtime overhead if all the flags are set to false.
 * 
 * The downside is that in order to change the flag you have to recompile any
 * classes that use the flag.
