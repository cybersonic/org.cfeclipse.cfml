 *    Revision 1.1  2004/11/09 04:44:29  smilligan
 *    Uber monster FTP stuff commit.
 *
 *    This is mostly working now, but there are a few known issues:
 *
 *    External files and remote FTP files don't get a LHS ruler. That means no line numbers, no folding etc.
 *    FTP files don't correctly report when they are read only, so they appear editable, appear to save, but the changes aren't stored on the server.
 *    You can currently only create new ftp connections. There isn't an interface for managing them.
 *    The FTP stuff probably needs to be done in it's own thread with a progress monitor. Othewise it can kill your workspace if it dies.
